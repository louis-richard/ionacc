## Abstract

We investigate two flow bursts in a series of Earthward bursty bulk flows (BBFs) observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft in Earthâ€™s magnetotail at (-24, 7, 4)~$R_E$ in Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric (GSM) coordinates. At the leading edges of the BBFs, we observe complex magnetic field structures. In particular, we focus on one BBF which contains large-amplitude magnetic field fluctuations on the time scale of the proton gyroperiod, and another with a large scale dipolarization. For both events, the magnetic field structures are associated with flux increases of supra-thermal ions with energies $\gtrsim 100~\textrm{keV}$. We observe that helium ions dominate the ion flux at energies $\gtrsim 150$ keV. We investigate the ion acceleration mechanism and its dependence on the mass and charge state of H$^+$ and He$^{2+}$ ions. We show that for both events, the ions with gyroradii smaller than the dawn-dusk scale of the structure are accelerated by the ion bulk flow. For ions with larger gyroradii, the acceleration is likely due to a localized spatially limited electric field for the event with a large-scale dipolarization. For the event with fluctuating magnetic field, the acceleration of ions with gyroradii comparable with the scale of the magnetic fluctuations can be explained by resonance acceleration.
